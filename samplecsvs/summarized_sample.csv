Dancing on the Crest of Reality,Louis,Mushrooms,1/5/2021,2004,Male,Not Given,130 lb,Mushrooms,oral,1.75 g,(dried),,,,,"Mushrooms : General , Various","What a profoundly great day.

This, being my second encounter with mushrooms, all began after lunch.  I headed over to a good friend of mine's house, just expecting to chill out.  Before I knew it, there were some shrooms in front of me and I was eating em right up.

So, I tried to keep a log book of everything that happened, and after about 20 minutes of orderly, rational thought, i just left the log book behind and headed out onto a glorious warm afternoon in the end of May.  With my friend, J., as my ground man, we headed out for a great walk that involved some deeply profound conversation.  As I walked through the field behind his house, remembering a dream from that morning where I had been walking in a gutter for miles and finally looked up at the beautiful sun, I happened to glance up, and then I realized that I was breaking through to the other side - the truer side - of reality.  I thought I could hear thunder over head.

People, places, faces ... oh where did this long strange trip go?  Riding in the car listening to Bob Dylan's 'Desolation Row' with a corresponding illustrated book that came out of nowhere.

J, being the good friend that he is, thankfully took me out to the Art Museum. (highly recommended) I realized there that the art museum is just a way for right-brain thinking to make its way into our disgustingly left-brain world.  I didn't even need the big rectangular building, I just played in the living artwork out behind it.  Giant concentric circles you can run through!  A ridiculously-huge, overly-patriotic, ginormous complicated windmill!  A field of wheat with children playing!  How utterly fantastic is that!

As I sat on a bench in a field behind the museum, my vision suddenly became much more distorted than it already had been.  I was already seeing beautiful colorful visuals creeping in, but now reality itself was being f--ked with.  Picture, I guess, a film running in front of a light, which produces your standard projection on the wall.  Now, pretend you were to take your finger and warp and twist the film as it went in front of the light...that's shrooming.

Reality got bent.

So, of course, we end up discovering a hidden pathway that leads to a bridge over a major interstate and obviously, this had profound implications for me in my life, etc.  
I drove by a school today and, seeing the kids just sitting there, lifeless, looking through lifeless books and papers nearly upset the whole trip.  I must seize each day and enjoy it.  There is no option here...one way or another, we are charged by God with the task/joy of exploring each new day.  So, screw reality as I know it.  When I annihilate all that falsity, all that's left is the Truth.  I hope.",https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=33960,,"**Trip Report Summary**

Never More Scared,Zing,Mushrooms,3/10/2018,2003,Male,Not Given,145 lb,Mushrooms,oral,1.75 g,(dried),,,,,"Mushrooms : General , Bad Trips , Alone","I had never done mushrooms before. I had smoked weed and drank alcohol and always have had a deep intrest in trying acid.  I thought mushrooms were a good compromise after seeing some of the horrible trips people experienced from acid.

I took the shrooms with some water after work at about 1030 at night.  I was aware it caused insomnia but I didnt think it was as intense as it ended up being.  I chatted with some friends online while I waited for them to kick in, and as expected, they started to around 1130.

I laid down on my bed with the lights off and Ween playing full blast on my headphones.  I really enjoyed the visual activity I was experiencing.  It was fun to turn the lights on and see the difference in the stucco ceiling I have.  Rainbows in the shape of stars shot around the ceiling and the colors in the room were SO intense that I was drawn into their power.  Time seemed to stay still and all of the songs fused together.  I was having such a good time watch the after image of the light bulb when I shut off the light.

It was about 230 in the morning that the anxiety began.  I got really tense and nervious.  I really wanted to fall asleep, but everytime I shut my eyes, I would just have different images flying around in my head.  I turned off the music and concentrated on coming down from the trip.  When Im stoned and feel like coming down it is so easy, but with the shrooms it was a different story.  Trying to come down made time pass so much slower and I felt like I was in a time warp.  This was in a time when I was already slightly depressed and All of the everyday anxieties I had came into mind and made me feel so mad.

At about 330 in the morning, I got up from my bed, and walked around.  I went into the bathroom to spray my face with cold water but I was so captivated by the mirror that I had to leave.  I went back into my room, and laid down on the floor.  I thought for some odd reason this would help me come down.  All that happened though, was that I saw the box cutters I used for work.  I looked at them and contemplated suicide.  I even remember thinking that it was more effective to cut along the arm rather than across.  I was so close to doing something really dumb when I realized what I was doing.  It was not worth it to take my life because of some stupid feeling I had when I was in a mind altered state to begin with.  I laid back down on my bed and eventually fell asleep.

I was truely more scared that night than I ever have been.  I realize that I almost took my life.  Fortunately all of the times I have done shrooms since then have been with many friends around, and when I felt much safer.  I am still aprehensive to take acid because I have heard of people doing unbeleivable things which have either killed them or someone else, or close to it.",https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=37914,,"**1.

The dose described in this report is very high, potentially beyond Erowid's 'heavy' range, and could pose serious health risks or result in unwanted, extreme effects. Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.]

I had done mushrooms once in my life, I only ate about 2 grams. I'm a pretty hardcore druggie, so it didnt do much for me, besides make my sponge painted walls look pretty cool. Besides that colors just looked a little moor vibrant. So, when my boy friend ian got a hold of 7 ounces, I decided to take a lot more.  I ate a 5 gram cap at first, and after about 10 minutes I decided to eat 5 more grams of a combination of stems and caps.

About and hour later, ian and I were watching fear and loathing in las vegas (the ultimate drug movie) and I glanced over at my smashing pumpkins poster on the wall, it appeared that the letters were moving around, getting bigger and smaller, it seemed to be sparkling.  Again, my walls looked amazing. I looked at ian and started laughing, he said my pupils were really big, even though he had only eaten half of what I had eaten, he said the effects were coming on pretty strong for him. And thats when my night took a turn for the worst. I started feeling overwhelmed, when I burried my head in my pillow, it looked like there was another world inside of it, the shrooms fully kicked in while my face was still in the pillow. When I finally lifted me head up, my room was just one big blur... This is when the psychological effects started kicking in. Everyone says shrroms are like LSD minus the paranoia.  But believe me, this was nothing like acid. I felt like there was something else in the room with us, I couldnt figure out what it was though. Then I realized, it was the light.  There was a radiant light coming from the corner of my room, it was telling me to show ian how to see it. (whatever that means!) I started blacking out. I felt something grab me b y the shoulders, it took me a few minutes to realize it was ian.. I told him I didnt think I was going to make it, and even if I did survive this terrifying trip, things would never be the same for me.

It was very fair to say I took to much. I Tried to get up and automatically fell over. Ian took me outside. Despite the complete terror I was in, going outside did make it better. The sky looked beautiful. I looked at the grass and it looked like it was smoking. We sat down and smoked a cigarette, for some reason I felt like the catapillar from alice in wonderland. Looking at ians face is had letters and numbers zooming across it. I finally started to come down, and we went inside, I heard beats of bass in my head, voices, music. All I wanted in the whole world was to go to bed and have this maddness end. It took an hour and 20 mins. To kick in, I felt the full effects 15 mins. After that... Unfortunately, my plateau was 5 and a half hours, and come down was about an hour or two.

I Will NEVER shroom again, I hated it.

This was my first trip with psilocybin mushrooms. I've had pretty positive experiences with psychedelics prior. 2 previous unpleasant trips had occured, both on AMT, during a time of great stress in my life, having problems with former gf, etc. I'm not a particularly spiritual person in the traditional sense and consider myself an atheist. I use psychedelics for the purposes of gaining insight into myself and my reality and for general recreation. I've been diagnosed with 3 mental illnesses which I don't believe to be accurate: Bipolar Disorder, ADHD, and minor OCD.

This report is from a trip on psilocybe cubenis several weeks ago.

Bought 1/2 an ounce (14 grams) of some, later to be discovered, very unpotent mushrooms from a fellow at work with the intent to ingest them sometime that week. About 3 days later, Saturday, I talk a walk to the local convience store and get some OJ, a pack of marboro, and a weekly world news, and walk home. I divide out about half of the mushrooms (Approximately 7 grams) and take a sip of OJ, put the mushrooms in my mouth and begin chewing. Orange juice completely kills the somewhat earthy not too unpleasant but far from appetizing taste of the mushies. Take about 5 minutes to thouroughly chew and swallow all the mushies. About 20 minutes begin to feel the familiar tryptamine buzz. I put on a Parliament Funkadelic compilation CD. After about 30 minutes I feel them completely take effect and put the cd in my discman, headphones on, and go for a walk through the paths in the woods. I am barefoot and the ground is mooshy from recent rain. I walk through this path for an hour or so, enjoying the beatiful hues of the forest. Smoke a few cigarettes along the way and walk back home. I watch some tv. Lay on my kitchen floor for most of the remainder of the trip enjoying the music and smoking some more cigs.

After about 3-4 hours I start feeling agitated, restless, and slightly upset/depressed. I go to change the music and put on a Doors live album, Disc 1. I continue to grow gradually more unsettled and start seeing depressing imagery in all of the programs on tv. I try to call several people during the trip but nobody is home. The one person I managed to reach was going out at the moment so it was a quick call. I seem to have a strong need for other humanly contact, especially during trips. Which is quite odd as I'm usually very reclusive and isolate myself from other humans the majority of the time. I'm very uncomfortable in social situations and feel that I'm too dissimiliar from others to relate in a proper manner. No other substances were ingested during this time. I would like to try mushrooms again as I feel they could have more to offer and just that the set and setting were probably off, and perhaps it was just the wrong time.",https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=11727,,"**1.

I finally know what Terence Mckenna is talking about, when he says you need to take high, high doses. I think I took the equivalent of at least 5 dried grams of cubensis. I was sitting at my computer looking up some shit on the internet, and it hit me all at once. I couldn't move, I couldn't function at all. I was completely immersed in an other dimensional world, the hallucinations came on very strong and very fast, non-sensical images and patterns exploded out of the blackness. They built up and built up. I thought, oh shit, I took waaaay too much. I tried to just go with the flow, but this was way more intense than any drug I've ever done.

The patterns melded into machines and weird technology, which evolved in a matter of seconds into super-dimensional hyperspace technology, but it was organic and everything was shades of green and yellow and brown. I saw several little green beings who beamed visual and auditory hallucinations directly into my brain. It was like the static noise on a tv with the volume turned all the way up. They were speaking some language that I'd never heard before. It was like english, but infintely more complex, and every once in a while I could make out an english word, but it was complete nonsense, like 'televisual orderment cantalize qualities mourn cotterize' and then another burst of deafening static. They seemed desparate to tell me something, I could understand what they were saying visually, but it wasn't anything that could be explained in words.

Images were shooting by me at lightening speed, the most bizarrre imagery you could imagine. Aliens committing strange pseudo-sexual acts on each other, more and more technology, technology that as it evolved melded more and more with these beings, and they became one with all the matter around them. It felt like they were grabbing me by the arms and yelling at me. I could feel them pulling me one way and another, as they desperately beamed this information to me faster and faster, more and more intensely. I couldn't take it, I thought for sure I've gone insane, I've completely blown my mind, I'm never coming back from this.

If I turned my head and looked somewhere else, sometimes the hallucinations would start to disperse, but then all the geometrical shapes in my field of vision would meld to together and rush at me, and I'd be back in this alien world. The biggest underlying theme of the trip was technology. It was like I was being imparted with knowloedge about the human potential and the infinte other worlds and civilizations out there. It didn't seem like the kind of shit that my subconscious mind would create. It was completely alien, completely real, and unlike anything I could have begun to imagine. I don't know what mushrooms are, but I think they are a key to understanding the nature of reality and the nature of the human mind. I was not prepared for anything I saw, even if you're an experienced tripper, this is intense shit, it totally fucks with your head. Proceed with caution, but if you think you can handle it, a level 5 trip is truly something else and it's absolutely mindlblowing.",https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=35516,,"**Psychedelic Trip Summary**
