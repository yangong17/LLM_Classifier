This decision was made on a whim, with very little preparation taken beforehand. My previous experience with substances consisted of two mushroom trips (one on 3 grams and one on 5 grams), as well as alcohol and heavy cannabis use. I lived in a suite with about 5 other people at the time, all of whom I considered good friends. Still, I knew they did not share my newfound rabid enthusiasm for psychedelics and may have been concerned or taken aback upon hearing me talk about them too much. Thus, I decided it would be best not to announce to anyone there that I was tripping. It had all gone smoothly the last time I did a high dose, so I figured I would be fine as long as I stayed in my room. Oh, how wrong I was.




I weighed out and consumed the mushrooms before heading to the bathroom, planning to take a quick shower before the first effects started to kick in. As I stood in the dirty, claustrophobic, dimly-lit communal shower I began to feel strange bodily sensations and mental fog. This happened within maybe 15 minutes of ingestion. I felt a bit uneasy but figured I would just hurry up and make it back to my room before anything crazier happened. Already, the trip was off to a destabilizing start. The mushrooms had kicked in much sooner than I expected, and the body load had an intensity I had never felt before. I put on my pajamas and decided to listen to some music as the effects ramped up. Initially, the music was nice and I was having an okay time. I then decided to replay the same song I had been listening to a few times. For some reason, this action flipped a switch in my head. What am I doing? I began to feel like I was going in circles, moving in a physical and mental loop in my tiny dorm room. I lost track of what I was supposed to be doing or why I was doing anything at all. 




Oh no, I thought, I don't like this. That's when everything went downhill. Why did I take these? What have I done? Oh, I'm such a fucking idiot. I began to spiral. I got the sense that life was a huge cosmic joke, that I was going nowhere. The atmosphere became dismal and eerie. I was feeling emptier by the minute. I desperately needed a change in setting, so I turned off the lights hoping I might be able to relax easier. This didn't work. I had informed my sister earlier that I was tripping and would call her if things got bad. I shouldn't have placed that responsibility on her, especially since she had never tried psychedelics and had no idea what I was going through. Regardless, I called her and she picked up, said something like, ""Oh noâ€¦"" and looked at me with pity. To me, it looked like she had somewhere to be and I didn't want to be a burden, so I told her I was fine (although I was very much not), she told me to hang in there, and I ended the call. 




That didn't help at all. I was suddenly alone again in my dark room. I felt nausea creeping in and the weight on my body was sucking all my energy. I felt numb, tired, anxious, and weighed down by a strange existential dread. This force was so heavy I felt like I was going to pass out. I didn't have any trip killers, but I desperately wanted this to end. 
I strongly considered throwing up the shrooms and pulled my trash can towards me (although this probably wouldn't have helped anyway as the psilocin had already entered my system). I didn't, instead I sat for what seemed like an eternity in my desk chair as I gradually lost all sense of who I was. Looking out the gloomy, dark window did not help. Not feeling an attachment to my identity should have brought peace, but in this state it was deeply disturbing. I knew that I had to ""let go"", but I had no will to let go, or to do anything anymore. It was like every ounce of hope had been drained from my being. I felt lost. I couldn't make myself feel anything besides this anxious emptiness. I was no longer in control of my own mind. Time became unreal. I felt disconnected from the source of everything, and I was certain I had gone permanently insane. I was completely and utterly alone, with no life to look forward to and no ultimate purpose.




As this continued, I couldn't even muster the strength to sit up in my chair, so I climbed onto my bed and laid down. I tried closing my eyes, opening them, looking around. Nothing made the feeling stop. Disorienting patterns were flowing on the walls. My own room felt foreign to me. I entered this weird limbo state where nothing was real outside of my disembodied consciousness. I didn't see physical demons but felt malevolent presences coming and going as I sat in the dark, mocking and punishing me for my arrogance. It was an experience of eldritch horror, punctuated by overtones of a cosmic loneliness 
I entered this weird limbo state where nothing was real outside of my disembodied consciousness. I didn't see physical demons but felt malevolent presences coming and going as I sat in the dark, mocking and punishing me for my arrogance. It was an experience of eldritch horror, punctuated by overtones of a cosmic loneliness
 beyond human imagination. 




I couldn't make sense of the dimensions I entered. I closed my eyes and saw dark, lifeless, repetitive geometry flowing behind my eyelids. Black and white parallel lines stretched out into the void as far as I could see. I could look around in my mind's eye and explore this space, but all I would find was the same eternal pattern. This was the physical location of hell. I had these convictions that I was dead and that I was truly alone in the universe, that the whole world was fake and in actuality there was nothing but me. What I perceived in my sober waking state as ""reality"" was not real and I had just pulled back the curtain to reveal the true reality: a dark, timeless void of empty space stretching out towards infinity. This was what the universe truly was. Every value, goal or hope I held for the future, every relationship, everything that drove me to live, became superficial and meaningless. I could only focus on how life had always been this way and would continue to be this way forever. This was my place, and I was going to be trapped here for all eternity.




After what must have been a couple hours, I somehow had the faintest idea that I could turn this around. I 
searched, ""I'm having a bad trip"", not expecting to feel any better. I came across an animated video. The music, humor, bright colors and overall message helped ground me back into human reality. I decided I needed to surrender and accept how I was feeling. I had been resisting this trip since it started, telling myself that I didn't like it and holding onto my ego. The video helped me feel amazing for a bit, like I had faced and conquered a demon, but the longer I spent in my room the more I slipped back into that same loop of existential dead. I decided that I needed to do something with myself. I was having inklings of needing to be somewhere, of ""not being in the right place"", not sure how else to describe it. It was 12 AM at this point and I was wary of wandering around my college campus at midnight on drugs. Still, I decided to get dressed and go out, as I had an uncontrollable desperation to get out of this room. The idea of trying to act sober in front of my friends, who I knew were in the common room, was really overwhelming and something told me they were going to judge me intensely. As I passed them, I think I muttered something like, ""I'm gonna go for a quick walk"". I couldn't really make out the looks on their faces, but I could tell some of them were a bit concerned. They still had no idea I was tripping.




As I walked aimlessly down the road outside my dorm building, I felt worlds better than I did in my room, no longer tortured by the cosmic void, but I still felt lost and lonely and unsure of who I was. I also had no plan for where I was going. That was when I saw someone on a bike coming towards me. Paranoia initially kicked in and I started to freak out, but I soon realized it was one of my good friends who had been at a party that night. She happened to live in my suite as well. A familiar face at that moment did wonders for my mental state. She was heading back to the suite and asked me what I was doing walking around alone at midnight. She seemed concerned. I could hardly string a sentence together, but I remember telling her that I had taken 4 grams of mushrooms and was having a really awful time. I was embarrassed about this and assumed I was acting pretty strange. However, she assured me that I was acting normal and she wouldn't have even known I had taken anything. This calmed me down a bit, but something still told me she had the strong right to be mad at me. I felt guilty, and I started shaming myself for being such an impulsive idiot. Now my friend had to take care of my dumb ass. She was pretty shocked at my decisions, but she didn't speak in a judgmental tone or blow the situation out of proportion. She was really chill about it. I started walking with her back to the dorm as she walked her bike. 




Eventually, as we walked and talked, my feelings of doubt subsided and were replaced by gratitude. I asked if I could ride her bike, and she agreed. I did a few laps around the courtyard in front of our dorm building. I felt like a little kid. Almost at the drop of a hat, my trip shifted in a positive direction. After this short bike ride, we entered the suite where I found two of my other roommates talking and watching Pirates of the Caribbean. I remember my friend who walked me home telling them in a funny, almost amused tone that she had found me wandering the streets on shrooms. Nobody seemed weirded out or angry, just concerned that I had decided to go outside in this state. They were surprised I was on shrooms and hadn't told them, and they laughed along with me about how crazy I was for doing this. We all had a good conversation and I sat down to watch the movie with them, which made for great entertainment. I finally began to laugh and experience the familiar euphoria as the effects of the mushroom dissipated. I felt so welcome, I can't even really describe the feeling. I was in the perfect place at the perfect time; I was home.




I spent the comedown in deep contemplation. As I sat in the common room, I was overwhelmed with gratitude, relief, and love. I don't know what might have happened if my friend hadn't found me. I thought about what a miracle it was that our paths crossed, and how grateful I was to her, and to the rest of my friends, for simply being there. This brought me to the verge of tears. They all showed concern and welcomed me so warmly. Of course they didâ€”they were my friends. But for some reason, in my shroom headspace, this took me by surprise. I had been isolating myself. These were my closest friends, yet I still didn't feel comfortable telling any of them I was tripping due to fear of judgment. But that judgment never came, or at least, was never strong enough to change the way my friends felt about me. What was I even afraid of? Of course they weren't going to disown me for doing shrooms. They cared about me. I thought about the cosmic loneliness I felt earlier. That was the fate that awaited me if I closed myself off, if I didn't accept my oneness with everything, including other people.  I had been this way for most of my life, living in intense fear of social interactions until I began to branch out in college. Even after a year of great friendships there, I still held many insecurities and exhibited old tendencies to self-isolate and neglect my friends. I was hiding away in my room, knowing I was making stupid, shameful decisions, and this set the perfect stage for a negative experience. I think that the shroom was ultimately leading me to make contact with my friends so I could learn this lesson.




This trip was one of the most horrifying yet illuminating experiences of my life. 
After this experience, I was afraid to be alone. Every time night fell and I would find myself alone in my room, the haunting feelings of emptiness and non-existence would resurface. The world took on a negative twinge, the opposite of the rejuvenating afterglow I had after my positive 5 gram experience. For about a week afterward, I experienced derealization. I was disconnected from my surroundings, like an observer unable to interact with the rest of humanity. Life felt so depressingly meaningless for a while and I found myself questioning why I was here at all.",https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=116461,LLM ERROR
A Near-Life Experience,drippingmagic,Mushrooms,3/14/25,2017,Male,23,,Mushrooms,oral,Handful,(dried),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mushrooms : General , Difficult Experiences , Mystical Experiences , Music Discussion , Therapeutic Intent or Outcome , Small Group (2-9)","One evening, three of us decided to consume some dried mushrooms we harvested earlier in the season. We did not have any scales to measure it, so we each took a handful of shrooms with a fistful of hope. The mushrooms were dried, deep dark blue, they looked menacing. Just thinking about them gives me the shivers. 




In less than 30 minutes of consuming them raw, they hit us like a truck! The mate whose room we were in, collapsed into a fit and started seizing claiming the devil had possessed him. He spasmed and seized as a fish pulled out of the water. He could barely get words out. All he managed to get out was -""I'm in hell! let me out!"" The 2 of us were traumatized, and could not relate to what he was going through at this point. We helped him to his bed and played some soothing music to calm him down. He did calm down in a few minutes thankfully but wanted to be by himself. Fair enough. We left him and decided it was going to be a solo ride for each of us.  




I quickly make my way home as I feel the intensity of these mushrooms that are unfolding. I  see that my housemates have called a few friends over and are watching the game together in the living room, my room is right next to the living room. ""Perfect!""- I thought to myself. I  gave a quick wave with a big mushy grin on my face and slid by into my cave.  




The first thing I attempt to do is put on some music to drown out the chatter from outside and the noises inside (my head). I connect my speakers and put them on my trip playlist.  ""This feels different, I do not remember feeling like this before on mushrooms, maybe I  need to change the lighting in the room, and the music perhaps"". I switch off the lights and just let my red lava lamp kept on the highest shelf dictate the settings. This made my room look like hell. What was I thinking? I clearly wasn't.  




The entire setting was now different, a lot darker. I could still hear the incessant chatter outside. My stomach was gurgling and twisting. My head was spinning like a merry-go-round. My vision was slowly blurring. ""If we all ate the same mushrooms, we all might be feeling this way?"" I was questioning whether they were the right kind or did we fuck up?  There wasn't much in terms of the infamous psilocybin visuals, everything seemed like a  hazy blur, and the sounds were getting louder and more sinister. I thought we had eaten some wrong mushrooms and might be dying right now. I froze in a cold sweat, I felt the panic suddenly begin to creep and crawl all over my body like an army of ants. 




Being the most experienced among the 3 of us, I was sure we had picked the right ones; I  was certain they were right. I had checked them thrice before drying them out. It felt like I was poisoned and the only way out was to call for an ambulance. ""I shall first get myself picked and then go get my other friends picked up"". I felt sure by now that I'd eaten the wrong ones. This did not feel anything like the magical experiences I've had on Mushrooms. 




I had never taken mushrooms at night as I could never enjoy the visuals as much, also, I  always felt some sort of dark predatory energy lurking about.  There I was, thinking I'm dying. Something had to be done right away. ""But I'm under the influence, I'm not thinking straight."" - I thought to myself. I had three options that I could think of- 




1: I go outside and try to explain to my drunk housemates what I am going through. Was not feeling up to it at all.  




2: Call for an ambulance and explain to them what is happening. Was not feeling up to that either. 




3: Just ride it out. I was feeling pretty up to it. 




I made up my mind; I wasn't up for the first two as there would be too much explaining to do and plus the spacing out mid-sentence/ thoughts, no thanks. I guess riding it out was a  better option. I was barely functioning at this point. It seemed like my anxiety was peaking as well. My thoughts kept looping into each other, like waves crashing onto the shore hoping to reach the farthest point, only to be swallowed back up by the ocean doomed to repeat its cycle of building up and collapsing again, forever, until the end of time.

My thoughts kept looping into each other, like waves crashing onto the shore hoping to reach the farthest point, only to be swallowed back up by the ocean doomed to repeat its cycle of building up and collapsing again, forever, until the end of time.
  Here I was getting to the point where I felt I was slowly going mad.  




I crawled into bed, put on a Shpongle set on, 
shut the curtains, and lay down on my bed, unsure if I was going to make it to the other side. I managed to get under my blanket,  like an earthworm sliding into the soil. As I did, I felt the back of my headrest into the cool comfort of my soft pillow, my head sank into it. I was able to register it in its totality, despite my mental drizzle of spilling thoughts and mental loops.  I was sinking into comfort, my safe space, the place where I would put my body to rest, to recharge. ""I swear to be way more cautious next time before experimenting"", I whisper to myself, as tears are rolling down my face. I can slowly feel my body paralyzed. I say sorry multiple times over to my family and friends for making them go through this. I don't mean to cause them this much trouble and pain. 




I sneak a soft peek between the curtains into the inky night sky. The stars are twinkling in all their fiery glory. I slowly pull the blanket over my head, close my eyes and start saying goodbye to myself, hoping to see daylight. I guess this is it, I get to a state of acceptance, a  state of surrender. I'm not certain when, but sometime during this initial period, I come to realize, I was going through ego death, something I had read about. 





My idea of myself was evaporating and I was clinging on to it as Velcro sticks to itself. Why was I holding on to this 'idea' so dearly? I had no idea. All my resistance was dropped as I  realized what was happening, I completely gave in and surrendered to it. The live set robbed some of the intensity as I could hear applause after each track which reminded me that I am still here, in this realm, and not fully out of it.  As I let go, my grip on control loosened, and I began dissolving into no-thing-ness.  




My identity evaporated, language was a joke. It made sense and it did not, music made sense, math made sense, geometry made a lot of sense, and telepathy made sense. Words are too limited to describe anything because I end up describing things with limited perspectives, emotions, and feelings I may hold towards certain topics/ events/ subjects/ objects which cannot and should not be put forth in words. Energy, vibrations, and frequency were silent but they were speaking loudly. It felt like I was being prepared for some sort of reparation. 




I evaporated into darkness, nothingness, the void. I was seeing a bit of light and saw myself as burnt ash or some sort of spore dust from outer space, specs of it floating in the air and spreading in different spots around the planet. I felt I was the spore and at the same time, I  was witnessing my state of what I was. It was like deep meditation; being the observer and repeatedly getting absorbed by the object being observed like a psychedelic Uroboros. Over a period of transformation, I became a mountain, which was broken down by a fiery age of erupting volcanoes followed by an ice age. Over what felt like centuries, I became a pebble in the river. The river flooded and got me onto land, I disintegrated into the soil, and the soil then held space for organic life. Now I was sprouting; I had leaves, a flower head, and a plant body.  After a few days of growth, I got consumed by an animal, that animal got consumed by another animal, and so on. It felt like my energy from being dust to stone to the soil, to plant had now been transferred to a primate. The primates rapidly started going through an evolution. 




The Stone Age, the bronze age, and the iron age while I was still some sort of exterior subject witnessing all of this happening. There were wars fought, orgies, families being raised, battles being lost and won, large celebrations among the hunters and gathers, blood, semen, and tears falling on the ground repeating cycles of nourishing the soil and giving life to fungi, flora, and fauna of the planet and eventually being transferred back into the cosmic source of existence.  




There were multicolor, holographic, geometric castles and pyramids being constructed from the sands of time, inhabited, eventually taken over, and destroyed. Dragons guarding treasures, being slain by warriors, new religions being birthed, the age of the Buddha.  The rise of urban civilization, humans being raised, raped, educated, and kidnapped; factories,  skyscrapers, farms, and roads being built and demolished all at a rapid pace. New life emerging in different corners of the world, blooming and decomposing before me. Duality at its finest. 




The cycles kept repeating in an infinite fractal-like manner. I hear applause from the Shpongle set which was a gentle reminder that it's just a dream and that you are still here, safe on your bed, alive. My pillow was soaked with tears of sadness, happiness, and ecstasy.  A tornado of emotions swirled through me. I could not believe what was happening, it was just beyond anything I'd experienced. 




I was slowly beginning to descend. Currents of gratitude began flooding my body, what felt like multiple lifetimes was around 5-6 hours. The sun peeked through my curtain and blessed me with its warm grace. I gently remove the blanket over me and take a deep inhale, I held it in and felt the life force expand within me, my body was awakening. The entire universe came to be whole at this very point of my peak inhalation. It felt like the universe was alive within me. Followed by a  long exhale through the mouth. My body contracted, it felt like it was nothing and everything at the same time, weightless. I manage to step outside of my room to find my housemates almost asleep and about to light the last joint before going to bed. I gently go sit next to them. 




""Are you alright mate? looks like you've been crying or having nightmares of some kind"",  one of them looks at me in a drained-out, stoned, droopy way and asks. He passes me the joint. ""Yeah.. sort of, glad I finally woke up"", I smile, still teary-eyed. 




Love.

My Ego in Waves,daytripper,Mushrooms - P. cyanescens,3/12/25,2010,Male,Not Given,180 lb,Mushrooms - P. cyanescens,oral,1.2 g,(dried),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mushrooms - P. cyanescens : General , Difficult Experiences , Mystical Experiences , Nature / Outdoors , Music Discussion , Public Space (Museum, Park, etc)","I sit now at my desk in my room listening to the peaceful vibes of Comfortably Numb by Pink Floyd after one of the strangest and scariest experiences of my life.  I 
tried marijuana countless times, DMT 4 times and, most recently, mushrooms on 3 occasions.  I consider myself a pretty scientific guy and will try just about anything I know enough about to feel comfortable.  After reading substantially about the pros and cons of mushrooms I decided to take my first trip with just .8 grams because that's what Albert Hoffman said he took in LSD, My Problem Child saying it was enough to feel the initial effects. Needless to say it was a pretty mild experience with only about 10 minutes of visual effects.  




The next time I took 1 gram and felt a substantially stronger effect from them, and then this time I took 1.2 grams of pure cyanescens caps. The first 2 times were cubensis caps and stems.  The first two trips I had were in my own house and yard with my girlfriend where I had complete control of everything.  This time we decided to take them before skiing.  Needless to say, not such a great idea.  We took them at 1030 am and its now 4:46 pm and I feel the final lingering effects wearing off.  I have read so much about ego, ego loss and ""turning off your mind and floating down stream"", but until now I had no idea what any of that meant. So here we go. 





945- We get to my buddies house and eat some breakfast.  Not much, just some oatmeal, toast and a banana.  He had never taken shrooms before so I only gave him 1 gram of caps and stems, figuring that would be mild enough for him, and the 1.2 of caps for myself since I wanted a little more.  We wrap the product in some plastic wrap and head up to the mountain.  




1030 â€“ I eat mine and wash it down with some powerade and Â½ an orange






1055 â€“ I start to feel the initial effects of a body high as we get into the lift line, I am thinking its going to be a great day. Never felt to effects this soon.




1105- We get to the top of the mountain and hike a little bit to get to the backside of the mountain.  We have to go through a dimly lit tunnel to get there.   The lights begin to get halos around them and the body high is very strong by now.  When we got to the top we came out of the tunnel and the brightness was overwhelming.  I was wearing very dark tinted goggles and still had to shut my eyes because of it, which did more harm than good for my mind cuz the CEVs were more intense than the light bouncing off the snow to me.  I kept calm by just shading my eyes for a minute or so until I was adjusted.  At this point everything was still pretty normal, other than the usual brightening of colors and body high. 




1110 â€“ We took the easiest way down and I felt like I was in the world super g championships.  I hadn't skied in a while and was pretty out of breath by the time we got to the bottom.  I forgot how thin the air is up there and I believe the lack of oxygen caused some unneeded anxiety later on.  There was no lines yet on the back side at this time so we rode right onto the lift.  Riding the lift up was my favorite part at this point because I could catch my breath and sink deeper into my trip by watching nature from above.  The snow was stunning and I could see every detail.




1115 â€“ Felt like I was flying on the ride down.  Lift line is getting a little more crowded, I don't really like all the people around me.  Still out of breath from the thin air, thinking to myself ""is this normal???""  My lips began to get a little tingly and numb but I figured it was just from the cold mountain air.




1120 â€“ Another good run and back into the lift line.  My buddy still claims to have felt no effects to this point, but I was trippin balls.  The lift line started to get really confusing and I felt like cattle being led into our stalls to be brought back to the top.




1125 â€“ I still hadn't looked at a clock up to this point but it seemed like a very long time since we took our first run. We decided to head back to the front side of the mountain where my friend saw a moguls course.  He went on it and ended up hurting his back, which didn't do me any favors cuz now instead of just worrying about myself, I now had to take care of a trippin injured friend.  We made it down to the bottom of this mid-mountain lift and I did not 
want to get on that lift.  I told him this but he told me he needed me with him.  I was the more experienced one so I went with it.  This is where things stated to get weird. I finally looked at my phone and it made absolutely no sense to me what this devise was used for.  I almost wanted to just drop it onto the mountain because it was useless to me.  He asked me what time it was and I remembered that was the reason I pulled it out in the first place.  1130!!!! Holy shit no way!!! It's only been an hour??!!!?! This made me very nervous. 
 I started to get panicky and tried to distract myself by watching the skiers.  This was no help.  I couldn't figure out why they all wanted to slide down a mountain on those sticks attached to their feet.  My world started to close in on me. 
I started to get panicky and tried to distract myself by watching the skiers.  This was no help.  I couldn't figure out why they all wanted to slide down a mountain on those sticks attached to their feet.  My world started to close in on me.
  My breathing became faster and the thin 9,000 foot above sea level air didn't help.  




I looked back to see how far we had gone and we weren't even 1/10th of the way to the top and I was stuck in this human transport device.  There was a point where the lift was just 5 feet off the ground and I had to use every last rational bit of myself to keep from jumping out.  I told my friend my situation and told him to tell me about some happy things in his life to keep me calm.  Didn't work.  Then, finally, what seemed to be over an hour later (5 min in actual time) we got to the top.  I was so relieved to be there that I just wanted to lay down, but I knew I couldn't cuz the ski patrol would freak out.  We made our way to the bottom, him with an injured back and me doing everything I can to keep myself together as the snow and trees swirled around me.  




1145 â€“ Finally we make it to the bottom.  The only thing that got me there was the thought of being freed from this mountain which was holding me prisoner.  
 There was a small concert going on at the patio where there are food places and tables to eat at.  As we walked there we started to get into a crowd of people.  These people were aliens to me.  We had absolutely nothing in common.  The sign above the sidewalk said ""returning riders"" which gave me some comfort, making me feel like I was just coming back to reality.  Not so fast.  Peoples brightly colored ski outfits and goggles were more foreign to me than ever.  I felt like I was in a bad dream and I would never escape.  Their smiles contorted on their faces. My friend led us to a table in the middle of the patio, but I couldn't handle it, too many people.  I told him we had to go sit off to the side.  When we got to our secluded table I almost had a sensory overload.  The music was too loud, the tabletop was swirling, the bricks on the ground flowing like water and even when I blinked it wouldn't go away.  I told my friend I needed to go for a walk and that I'd be fine.  




I found a stairway about 30 yards away from everything that saved me.  As I sat down I took a look at the cement wall on my left.  It was swaying back and forth, jamming to the music.  A peaceful feeling came to my mind when I saw that.  I felt as if it was a very happy wall because it gets to chill here and listen to music all its life.  Patterns and faces continued to swirl in this wall and I took a picture of it with my camera phone that I will keep forever.  I started to text my girlfriend which was calming.  At this point I gathered my thoughts and was regaining my composure.  I was trying to figure out why I was having such a bad trip and it began to occur to me, ""I've lost my Ego.""  Society became meaningless to me.  Buildings, people, musicâ€¦ they were all part of a strange system without purpose to me.  Before this moment I had no idea what people meant when they talked about egos in a psychedelic sense.  I gathered my thoughts enough to type this into my phone:




Ego cannot be put into words. It is everything we are and know. From the clothes we wear to the food we eat, everything is part of us and who we are.  This makes up our ego. We are so engulfed in it that we don't even recognize this ourselves. Our buildings, cars, houses and everything within them is part of an infrastructure centered on the human body and the way it functions. Time is a simple part of human nature and only exists because we think it does. In meditation, time stands still. Some force their way into this state through psychedelics, unprepared and unable to escape its effects. Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream is truly the only way to not lose your mind.




I listened to the first part of strawberry fields about 10 times in a row and came up with my own interpretation.  Strawberry Fields being a state of mind and John Lennon wanting to take his friend there.  His friend was nervous about the trip and he comforted him by telling him its ""nothing to get hung about.""






1230- My buddy was texting me to come eat with him and I finally decided I could go back into ""the game"" as described by Leary.  Everybody was mindlessly playing their roles in society.  When I sat down to eat with him he had a Reuben waiting for me.  I looked at the sandwich and had zero desire to eat it, and I love food in real life.  I was completely separated from my bodily desires still.  I could feel the effects wearing off at this point, but wearing off in waves.  My pupils still felt dilated and I was still slightly hallucinating.  I slowly felt myself coming back into what Leary said is the Third Bardo, where we reenter the world as we knew it and regain our ego.  




130- I finally feel like eating, but the thought of going on the chairlift again was overwhelming.  There was no way I was going to get trapped again on that thing.  My friend said he would go up and get the car and bring it to me.  This was a huge relief for me.  From this point on I began to regain my Ego in waves.  I felt human again and felt connected to the people around me once again.  He drove us home and I recounted my experience to him the whole way down.  He still claims to have only felt mild effects but agreed that he didn't like not having control over his mind.

400- The effects are worn off enough by now to drive so I go home.  I finally feel like I can go on with ""normal life"" again.  I feel completely reborn.  I woke up this morning not knowing what I was getting my self into and a few hours later. I was trapped on a mountain in outerspace.  My struggle to hold onto my Ego during my trip was caused by being around too many people I didn't know and forced into situations I didn't want to be in, such as riding the lift back up the mountain.  




430- I get back home, say what up to my roommates, tell them about my experience and go straight to my room and write this.  Leary says every time we trip we go into ""the land of heroes and demons"" and that we have to accept our bad trips as a learning experience.  Needless to say I think I learned more about myself and human nature in those 6 hours than I have in my entire life up to this point.   At certain points in my trip the traditional bad trip thoughts creeped into my mind such as; am I dying?, will I ever be normal again? and I am going to swear off mushrooms forever after this.  I had to keep reminding myself that everything would be ok, as it was, and that this was completely normal.  Now that I am down from my trip I am excited, but hesitant, to journey back into the world I just left.  Hallucinogens are still something I think everybody should experience, but under the right circumstances.  We cannot fear this unknown world because there is so much to learn there.  I have a new appreciation for life and view on relationships because of what I went through today. Hopefully the next time I trip it will be a good one and I plan to arrange my set and setting to ensure this.  Well, that's about it.  I'm pretty hungry now and I'm going to lay down and ponder some more about what just happened.

I began writing this report only a few hours after the conclusion of my first (and possibly my last) psilocybin therapy session on June 20, 2023. I say ""last"" not because it was bad, but because another one, at this moment, seems unnecessary: the message was abundantly clear and overwhelming. 




I can still feel lingering physical effects (e.g., hearing chirping birds that aren't there), and I am certain the psychological and emotional effects will endure â€“ some perhaps for the rest of my life. According to my guide (my teacher, brother, and friend), I had a ""big experience"" with an overpowering sense of ""non-dual"" reality. During the journey itself, I labelled what I felt, ""dying,"" but by that point, all labels, categories, and concepts had no meaning. Meaning itself didn't seem important anymore. Nothing seemed important; importance is just a concept, like all the other concepts we use in this world to help us do things. I simply surrendered to the infinite bliss of total self-dissolution. 




Whatever one might call it, it has been the most profound experience of my life. I have just completed the 30-question Mystical Experience Questionnaire (a few hours after the journey), and further to my amazement, all my answers are fives, the highest number on the scale.




Background




I am a 47-year-old who's been interested in psychedelics since first encountering the work of Terence McKenna as a teenager. My experience with mind-altering substances has been minimal: routine caffeine and alcohol, as well as some light and very infrequent cannabis use. In a few cases, anxiety, depersonalization, and derealization hung on long after consuming strains high in THC, leading me to mostly avoid cannabis. In recent years, I have done five IM ketamine treatments in clinical settings. These treatments improved my openheartedness, reduced my fear of psychedelics, and increased my interest in psilocybin, which the voters in my U.S. state legalized in 2022. 




Although I was reared by parents who practiced spiritual traditions, I do not consider myself a spiritual person. In fact, I tend to silently scoff at people's experiences of the mystical and divine. My practices involve hikes in the mountains and occasionally staring in wonder at the clouds and stars. I tilt toward rational, scientific, and analytical thinking. However, my interest in psychedelics and mysticism (through commentators including Watts, McKenna, Dass, Campbell, etc.) demonstrates a simultaneous interest in the ineffable, which I had never personally experienced beyond a few fleeting encounters with clairvoyance and premonition. I have long been skeptical that ineffable experience was worth talking about, since to be made meaningful, it must be brought into the realm of language. In hindsight, and according to my guide, this philosophical framework, somewhat paradoxically, may have helped me better understand and integrate what I experienced. 




Preparation, Set, and Setting




I am six-feet tall, 175 pounds, and aside from chronic back pain, fairly healthy. If I have suffered severe trauma in my life, I am unaware of it. I have a general sense of wellbeing and mostly positive self-regard. My intentions were to use this experience to satisfy a lifelong and intense curiosity, as well as a sense of personal and professional obligation to try this newly decriminalized medicine. I wanted to see if doing so might impart some knowledge or self-realization (hat tip Michael Pollan), and I wanted to finally overcome my fear of psychedelics. The three words I wanted to remember during the journey were: surrender, trust, and safety.




The setting was my home, with a small sofa-bed used for the session. My guide measured and prepared a tea of 3-grams of Ghost and Steel Magnolia mushrooms. We sat in ceremony, and then I drank the mixture out of a cup I'd made. The single dose was taken at approximately 10:30 am. It tasted surprisingly good, reminding me of shitake mushroom soup. My guide sat next to me, close enough to hold my hand, which he did for nearly the entirety of the journey once it intensified.




Having such a profound experience (as I describe below) on 3-grams of mushrooms may seem unusual, but I am sensitive to medicines in general, and I had also fasted for 48-hours before the experience (nothing but water). My guide told me after the session that he would have liked to have known about my fast. I presume it might have helped him better gauge the likely effects and duration of my dose.




Guide's Notes




It is clichÃ© that nothing can fully prepare someone for the experience of ego-death on a dose of psychedelic mushrooms (although careful preparation is still absolutely needed). I was neither seeking nor expecting the death of my ego. I didn't think it was even possible on three grams. But I can report that my experience was highly similar to other ego-dissolving trip reports I have read/heard. In fact, I learned today that most of the clichÃ©s about the psilocybin experience are true: visions of figures, images, and animals (in my case, tiki gods, Indonesian Batik patterns, and benevolent serpents); colors and geometry of unbelievable complexity and beauty. I laughingly reported to my guide: ""I can see ultraviolet now!""; unity with all beings and all times; no self-other distinction; complete surrender of all categories and concepts (especially self and time); and the feeling of being part of the never-ending multiplicity of the blissful unfolding of forever. Clearly, the previous sentence also reveals the accuracy of the clichÃ© that words fail to adequately capture the experience. I knew that truism intellectually before today, but I understand and feel its accuracy differently now. During the journey, feelings of overwhelming love were accompanied by unending awe and astonishment, feelings that I'd heard others talk about on countless 
video trip reports I'd watched. After today, I better understand these reports and find myself chuckling at instances where I now exclaim, when watching: ""Yes!"" ""Me too!"" or ""I know!""




What follows is a transcript based on my guide's notes. Reading this transcript is, to me, astonishing. I would not believe this journey happened if it were not for both my guide's notes and my fading recollections. I have not tried to interpret much of what I said. No interpretation seems needed.




About 45-minutes into the journey, the blackness of my eye mask became a screen for flowing colors: iridescent, shimmering, and self-transforming rainbows abounded. These were undoubtably shaped by the songs from the album, ""Migration,"" by Peter Kater and R. Carlos Nakai, which my guide selected for my journey. Acknowledging the visuals, he suggested going deeper. I surrendered even more to ""mama mushroom."" 




I began sobbing, thinking of the intense love I felt from, and for, my mother. ""She loved me so much!"" I exclaimed. ""When I was a baby, she never let me cry â€¦ I love my son the same way my mama loved me,"" I said, through tears.




My guide asked me if I thought I would want a booster dose. I was surprised, because it seemed very early in the journey, and the effects were much gentler than 100-mgs of ketamine (which I'd tired before). I was tempted for a moment to say ""yes"" to the booster, but having mentioned my mother, I felt she would have wanted her ""baby boy"" to stay safe, and since safety was one of my three words for the journey, I declined the booster dose. I'm glad I did because what then occurred was overwhelming. I am sure I would have been unable to stand any more medicine. 




My thoughts returned to my mother, who is elderly and in poor health. ""I love you so much,"" I burbled through my tears. ""You kept me warm and safe, and I want you to be warm and safe. I want you to be okay,"" I cried. I then decided to release my mom and continue to move through the beautiful, soothing, breathing colors. The musical lightshow in my mind incorporated visions of meandering, benevolent serpents. 




Then, I confronted before me: ""something."" Feeling ""infinite serenity and peacefulness,"" I asked out loud, ""What is it?"" I can now barely see it in my mind's eye, 
an infinitely transformable, fluid, multi-dimensional column or pillar of everything imaginable. Whatever can be imagined rises to its surface. I saw arising on the edge of it something that I knew to be ""me,"" the human me that was born, is having this material existence, and that will one day die and return to ""it."" I was certain that this ""thing,"" whatever it was, was everything. There was nothing above or below it, in front or behind it, before or after it. It just existed. It was existence. I was utterly astonished. 
I was certain that this ""thing,"" whatever it was, was everything. There was nothing above or below it, in front or behind it, before or after it. It just existed. It was existence. I was utterly astonished.
 I was in awe. My guide recorded my utterances:




""I'm astounded!""




""I had no ideaâ€¦ the infinite possibilities.""




""Infinite combinations, forever. Forever!""




""Whatever it is, I see it.""




""Infinite. Infinite. Infinitely changing.""  




""I'm from that. I popped out [of it]. I am one of those changes.""




""My mom, she loved me. I feel it. I am sooo lucky to be bathed in that love.""




""[It] is really fucking infinite! I am persuaded! I am astonished! I. Am. In. Awe!""




""There is no boundary between us. You are me, and I am you.""




""I'll leave that pain behind. It's back there.""




""You want to show me that? Okâ€¦ [a moment later] It's sooo beautiful! Really!?! [sobbing through tears] I. Am. Astonished!!!""




""I understand. I get it. Thank you!"" [laughing and sobbing through more tears]




""Oh. My. God. The ecstasy!!!




""I really am!?! Ok. It's sooo much. I'm from there!?! Ok."" [laughter]




""Oh. My. God!"" 




""Isn't it great!?!"" It's fucking great!!! Put that in the book, I say: ""It's fucking great!!!""' There's your testimonial!""




""There is no difference.""  




""I cannot believe how good it feels. Unbelievably blessed.""




""I want to do for You. [anguish] I am just so grateful. What do you want me to do, and I will do it. [sobbing] Of course, I willâ€¦ just show me what to do.""




""It says, 'just do what you're doing.'""




""That's it!?! That's it, huh? Just bathe in it forever? [smiling] Really? Okay.""




""Why are you so nice to me? I asked you to be [nice to me], that's true. Thank you. It feels so good.""




""It wants me to tell you, there is no 'you.'""




""We all go here? Really!?! Okay. Really!?! Because right here is sooo good. I am overwhelmed with the goodness of it all. I am convinced of the overwhelming goodness of it all. If I live here forever, I am fine with it! Just put an exclamation point on the page [and close the book]. [laughter]




""[It] is beyond the discourse. The rapture.""




""You've convinced me."" 




""Shall we stay here?""




""It said it gave me this body as a gift, to feel these things.""




""'Oh, we'll convince you' [it says]. It's So. Much. Love! Oh. My. God. The ECSTACY!!! Soothing, basking in it. Eternal bliss.""




""Don't you [people on Earth] want to try this never-ending bliss, forever? [laughing] It's right here [in a mushroom, right behind your eyelids, or in front of your nose]. Forever. Unbelievable."" [laughing]




""I don't understand why anybody would be frightened of it, ever. There is nothing to be afraid of. It's just pure, never-ending bliss forever."" [laughter, smiling]




""Something died, and I left it behind.""




""It is showing me that I am part of this. I'm in bliss forever. Oh. My. God. It's showing me.""




""This is where we all end up. 'Are you ok with it [it is asking me]'? Yes! Why wouldn't I be ok with it!?!"" [laughing]




""It's beyond any kind of rational understanding or any concepts of any kind.""




""We are love and light and bliss forever. Oh my God, the rapture is so glorious.""




[I ask for the time, and it is 1:15 pm]. ""I don't even know what that means."" [time] [laughter]




""'Here monkey [human, it is saying], let me show you a little of this.' I can't explain it. The Infinite.""




""You can't bring any of it back [lamenting]. [It's] ineffable."" 




""There is no 'there' or 'out there.'""




""I died.""




[after a period of silence, when my guide asked how I was doing] ""I just died and am in peace."" 




""I don't know who I am.""




""There is no boundary between whatever it is and us. We are it. We are that. Whatever it is.""




[coming to just a bit from the effects of the medicine. Removing my eye mask] ""I don't know where I was. I don't know what a body is. I went to a realm that is beyond everything. I can see how people say you are one with God. Every category and every boundary are obliterated. I can't understand what ""that"" is. [But] I am no longer afraid of death. [It] is beyond categories or concepts. Why would anyone want to be born [separated from it]? I don't know if I will ever come back [to Earth]. Part of me doesn't want to come back. There are no pains [in that place] in my body. You just get to be whatever 'that' is for eternity. Then you wake up. Whatever that was, there, it's everything. Always. Forever.""




[struggling to return from the medicine] ""There is a knowing [in my mind] or a part of me that knows I exist [as a human on Earth]. I am aware of having a body, but I am just existence. Is it ok to go back [to the endless non-place]? I guess I will just exist here now [in the endless non-place].""




[coming too even more now from the medicine] ""I don't know what anything means anymore. But some part of me knows that I'm a primate that needs water. [drinks water] There are days, sun, stars, existence [on Earth]? Holy shit! There is something called 'reality' that I know I will want to attend to. You can stop caring about being 'normal.' Normal was overrated.""




[the subsequent exchanges were not recorded, but I was struggling with my identity and the nature of reality for about an hour â€“ see ""Cautions"" below.]




Unasked Questions Answered




I want to make it clear that I did not consume psilocybin with an intent to gain answers to existential or metaphysical questions. Yet, the medicine delivered ""news"" that cannot be ignored.




I feel like a snake that has shed its skin - a man reborn on June 20, 2023. I feel like I can take from old ""me"" that which is useful and now leave behind all those memories, habits of mind, and concerns that no longer serve. 




Part of me wishes I had come to this transformation earlier in my life, but the truth is, I probably wasn't ready. I undertook this journey at an apex in my professional and personal life, which likely accounts for the strong, positive experience I had. My Living Will had been written earlier, my ""one good book"" had been finished, and I was prepared to die of a heart attack or suffer psychosis. I was free to fully let go.




I now believe that non-discursive, ineffable experience is possible. In fact, I would encourage any skeptic of mysticism or spirituality, like me, to try an ego-dissolving dose of psylocibin. I would challenge that person to maintain their skepticism when confronted with their experience.




I now feel like I know where we ""go"" when we die. I did not seek to know this, but I have seen and felt what I believed to be the source of all existence, and you and me and everything we can sense are the material expressions of its timeless, unending transformation and expression. I believe the self that I call ""me"" materially emerged from this source when I was conceived about nine months before my birth. When I die, my consciousness will return to this source in a way that may be like what I felt during my psilocybin journey. Another experience of ""me"" (as a rock, ant, bird, human, or alien, etc.) may be expressed again in some other time or material plane of existence, or not, I really don't know. However, I believe everyone I have known, and everything in this universe, emerged from this same source and are just expressions of it. In that way, we are all connected and all the same. Materially, we are all created from the same dust of stars, and existence is just each atom of each speck of dust. I now better understand what Alan Watts meant when quoting Hindu text that declared, ""You are That!""




Where does this existence reside? Does it encompass the distant reaches of space, is it inside our brain, just behind our eyelids, or in the smallest constituent quark of an atom? My answer is ""Yes"" and ""I don't know."" I am a mere hominid who consumed psilocybin and experienced something that cannot be explained in words or other symbols. While I have seen art that resembles aspects of what I saw and felt, it does not fully capture the astonishing awe and reverence that occurred while feeling the soothingly undulating, forever-transforming source of all existence, of which I am, and all things are, expressions separated only while we are experiencing our various material forms.




Do I believe in God now? If anyone wants to label what I saw and felt ""God,"" I won't object. But I won't use that word because it's just a word (a highly loaded one), and words have no meaning in the place I experienced. I believe I saw or experienced the source of all existence. But I happily concede that I could have been merely hallucinating on mushrooms. 




Did I go ""full hippie,"" and can I see God in a cabbage now? I can appreciate that everything is an expression of the source of all creation, but a cabbage isn't the source, it's a material expression of the source (and good in stir-fry). No, I do not suddenly believe in astrology, teleportation, past lives, astral projection, ghosts, or other such phenomena beyond them being amusing and sometimes useful concepts in our world. 




What is the purpose of life? I don't know the purpose of anyone else's life. I begged the source of all existence to tell me how I could ""give back"" for all the blessings I've had in mine. It only told me to keep doing what I'm doing. I said, ""That's it?"" I couldn't believe it. ""Why are you so nice to me?"" I asked? ""It's true, I asked you to be nice to me. Thank you,"" I said. I don't understand it all, but I feel mostly relieved of the burden to keep asking myself what I should be doing to give back â€“ the answer to that question, I know now, continually unfolds inside my heart. I can listen any time.   




I called my mom sometime after my journey to tell her again how much I love her, and how I know (maybe more than ever) how much she loved/ loves me. It was a beautiful conversation that probably would not have occurred otherwise. 




Two days after my journey, I can see some lingering effects, including an ability to better choose how I want to respond to people and situations around me. I find it easier to say ""with love"" in texts and emails to friends, and I feel more open and compassionate. My usual irritation with people and processes has, thankfully, eased. Yet, there is nothing remaining of the blissful astonishment I felt during my journey. 




I am still in a bit of shock about what happened to me. My skepticism is returning, but I cannot deny that I said and felt these things. In that way, I guess, I remain astonished. 





Don't let a 3-gram dose fool you: I completely dissolved. A guide should be someone absolutely trusted with one's life and sanity. More than five hours after my trip had begun, I felt I had ""returned"" from wherever I had gone. I no longer had any visual hallucinations or feelings of being ""under"" the influence of a psychedelic compound. The physical reality of my home had returned to how it always looked and felt. However, I was absolutely convinced that I had died and that whoever ""I"" was before the experience no longer existed and that the new person I had become would need to reconstruct an identity and relationships from total scratch. I believed I could probably do this with great effort, but I was anxious about doing so. Sensing my unease, my guide walked me to the area of my home where I keep photos of my loved ones and a shrine to my late father, ""Do you know who these people are?"" he asked. I said I did, but that they mattered to the old me, and the new me would have to learn how to relate to them because the old me had died.




I kept thinking, ""The 'me' who was here before died, so I guess I will just try to get by with being this crazy person now, doomed to suffer permanent psychosis until I die."" Through the repeated reassurances of my guide, I eventually found a way back to sanity. I looked many times into his eyes to see if he was scared that I had permanently slipped away. Either he genuinely believed I hadn't, or he was good at pretending (I am sure it was the former). I cannot imagine the panic and horror that I would have felt had he revealed even a flicker of doubt about my condition.





At the very end of my journey, my sanity seemed, at least to me, to be hanging by a thin thread. This occurred after having a gentle (yet awe-inspiring and ego-dissolving) experience that involved no fear whatsoever at any point. While my feeling of permanent psychosis disappeared before my guide left my home, part of the ""I"" who was ""me"" really won't ever come back. Luckily, I had prepared myself to be ok with that outcome.",https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=117453,LLM ERROR
A Body Positive Sexual Awakening,AirConditioner,Mushrooms,1/14/25,2023,Female,23,150 lb,Mushrooms,oral,6 g,(tea),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mushrooms : Sex Discussion , General , Alone","This is my second experience with psilocybin mushrooms to date, again blue meanies. That morning, I brewed ~11g of them into a peppermint liquorice tea. I had a plan and wanted it to go perfectly leading up to this trip, but in all honesty, it hadn't. I was upset, overstimulated, having an autistic meltdown and crying in the middle of a grocery store a few hours prior. 




I obtained a coffee filter to be able to filter off and strain the mushroom gunk from the tea and the final product was this deep green color. I pour some into a short glass, a dose of ~6g and begin to drink it down. It had this funky sickly sweet taste and felt weird going down my throat. 




Twenty or so minutes after finishing the mug, it feels like a very strong edible high on the comeup. I'm looking at the side of a shallow baking plan, seeing patterns manifesting in it, the beauty of one small imperfection repeating itself along the whole edge of the pan. I saw that the floor needed sweeping and began to do it as the house began to feel smaller. My goals for this trip were to confront some bad things like childhood trauma 
My goals for this trip were to confront some bad things like childhood trauma
, so I curate my trip playlist a couple days prior to be songs from my childhood. There's this sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu as I'm sitting in my mom's room and talking to her, feeling as if I'm able to talk to her from a less judgmental place and be vulnerable, as though the conversation I was having with her had been had many times over and to myself beforehand. I lay down on her floor and stare up at the white popcorn ceiling, but rather than white, it had all this added depth and color. Alongside that, I see some tracers from waving my hands in front of me. The bedroom light was very intense as I become still and begin to feel as if I'm dying, going to the light. I wasn't scared this time though, as it was beautiful, everything around me was. 




I eventually stand up again, feeling a bit wobbly at first, and begin feeling overwhelmingly nauseous, unsure where to go. The house felt so small and I didn't want to be stuck in a small bathroom while tripping, so I make my way to the bigger one, carrying a towel with me so I can lay on the floor. Unlike last time, I was unable to throw up and relieve my intensifying stomach pain so I opted for sitting on the toilet instead, repeating 1..2 over and over again to keep myself grounded and not so focused on the stomach pain. I call out to my mom who was in a different room, asking her which number came first. In the process of trying to shit, I strip off all my clothes and lock the bathroom store, ogling my own body in the mirror when I turn around. I felt like a child all over again growing up, having a sexual awakening, and loving her body, so I take a selfie. I'm on the toilet again and looking down at my male genitalia. I didn't want it there because it made society recognize me as a boy and a man; it would just be easier if it was gone. I'm on the floor laying on the towel now, so I take some more pics of myself, feeling this very sexual body positivity, wanting badly to share it with others and tell them to love themselves over and over. I look in the mirror and tell myself the same. I thought to myself that society didn't want people to unlock these things, that sex and loving yourself were one of life's many beautiful experiences, that you owe it to yourself to be kind to yourself the way you are to others. I felt I had taken what I needed to from this experience and that I could finally rest. 




Overall, I would consider this quite a glowing experience that helped me to love myself a little more and to practice grounding techniques if I'm experiencing overstimulation or discomfort.",https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=117763,LLM ERROR
